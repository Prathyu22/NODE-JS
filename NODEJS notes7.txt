Authentication has "headers" in it i.e., through headers, authentication can be implemented.

request (has)---> header
                  body
                  path 

content-type ---> tells browser which type of content is there in the body.

app.use() ---> allows us to use middleware.
               It acts as a middleware for each and every function without calling.
