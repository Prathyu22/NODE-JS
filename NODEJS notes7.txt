In case of express, module.exports() is a function --> returns the object.
app is an instance of express().

The 'search engine' can only make "GET" requests.

header ---> contains extra information of address.

The most reliable check is header check ---> from where the request coming from...

middleware ---> It is a verify function ---> It can have 3 parameters 
                                             1. request    
                                             2. response
                                             3. next  //The job of middleware is done.
                                        ---> This executes after "route" and before "callback().

next ---> proceeds to the next callback() / next middleware.
